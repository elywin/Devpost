# Why the command line?!?!
- greater control of an OS or application;
- faster management of many operating systems;
- ability to store scripts to automate regular tasks

When a user first enters a command line, they fidn it challanging because it requires them memorising a banch of commands
along with thier options. However once a user gets to know how to navigate the command line, know it's structure they are 
bound to be more productive providing the user with control, greater speed, and abiity to automate tasks more easily though
scripting.
