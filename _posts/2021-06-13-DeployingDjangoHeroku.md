**Deploying a Django application using Heroku**<br>
Before deploying the app we, we need to add a few configuration files and install some packages to run our app in the production environment.

1. Add a Procfile in the project root directory to define process types and explicitly declare what command should be executed to start your app.

> touch Procfile


Open the Procfile and add the line below.

> web: gunicorn djangoherokuapp.wsgi

**Note:**Change djangoherokuapp to the name of your project to point to the location of the wsgi.py file.

Add the following line to the procfile too.

> release: python manage.py migrate

This line will migrate your database on heroku

2. Add a runtime.txt file in the project root directory.

>touch runtime.txt

In the runtime.txt file add the following line specifying the correct Python version in regards to your django app environment.

> python-3.9.2

3. Install the following packages in the environment

> pip install gunicorn dj-database-url whitenoise

> pip install psycopg2-binary

> pip install django-heroku

**Note:** Check this [article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-app-configuration) out to see why you need these pacakages 

4. Add a requirements.txt file

> pip freeze > requirements.txt

**Note:**Heroku will recognize a deployed application as a Python application only if it has a requirements.txt file in the root directory. Even if your application has no module dependencies, it should include an empty requirements.txt file to indicate that your app has no dependencies.

Your requirements.txt file should look like this:

```
asgiref==3.3.4
dj-database-url==0.5.0
Django==3.2
django-heroku==0.3.1
gunicorn==20.1.0
psycopg2==2.8.6
pytz==2021.1
sqlparse==0.4.1
whitenoise==5.2.0
```

5. Add the following import statement to the top of settings.py:

> import django_heroku

6. Then add the following to the bottom of settings.py to activate Django-Heroku.:

> django_heroku.settings(locals())

7. Then add the following in the settings.pyâ€˜s middleware section (at the top):

> 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
