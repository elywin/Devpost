**What is Unit Testing?**<br>
UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.

The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness, a unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

# Why Unit Testing?

- Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.
- It helps the developers to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly
- Good unit tests serve as project documentation
- Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project. Tweak the code - until the tests run again.
