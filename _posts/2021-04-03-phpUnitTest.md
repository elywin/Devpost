**What is Unit Testing?**<br>
UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.

The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness, a unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

**Why Unit Testing?**

- Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.
- It helps the developers to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly
- Good unit tests serve as project documentation
- Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project. Tweak the code - until the tests run again.

**Types of unit testing**
- Manual
- Automated

> `The automated method is the most preferred as it is faster and more accurate, but performing this task manually is also an option`

Under the automated approach-<br>
A coder uses a UnitTest Framework to develop automated test cases. Using an automation framework, the developer codes criteria into the test to verify the correctness of the code. During execution of the test cases, the framework logs failing test cases and also automatically flag and report these failed test cases. Depending on the severity of a failure, the framework may halt subsequent testing.

**Unit Testing Techniques**
- [Black Box Testing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/black_box_testing.htm) - involves testing of user interface along with input and output.

[White Box Testing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/white_box_testing.htm) - involves testing the functional behaviour of the software application.

[Gray Box Testing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/grey_box_testing.htm) - used to execute test suites, test methods, test cases and performing risk analysis.
