**Project Scheduling**<br>
The policies, procedures and documentation that the project team is to put in place to ensure that the development of a project is completed on time.

> Breaking the total project work into separate activities â€“ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  estimating the required time for each activity Identifying parallel activities-happening at the same time Estimating resources needed Assigning responsibilities.

**Project Scheduling Techniques**<br>
Project schedules are represented as:
- WBS: A Work Break DownStructure partitions a large project into its component activities or products. It can be represented using either Hierarchical chart WBS or Indented list WBS.
- Activity networks: Activity networks represent this list in a graphical form with activities either on arrows or nodes. CPM and PERT are the two forms of activity networks. 
- PERT 
- Gantt: Two dimensional representations that show tasks and corresponding start and end dates.

Software management tools such as Microsoft Project can be used to implement the above techniques.
