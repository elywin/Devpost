title: Project Risk Management
---
Risk management is a process in which  risks that could potentially affect an organisation are identified, assessed and mitigated.

**What is a risk?**<br>
A risk can be defined as an event or circumstance that hurts your business/organisation, for example, the risk of having equipment or money stolen as a result of poor security procedures. Types of risk vary from organisation to organisation.

The most common business risk categories are:<br>
- Strategic: decisions concerning your businessâ€™ objectives
- Compliance: the need to comply with laws, regulations, standards and codes of practice
- Financial: financial transactions, systems and structure of your business
- Operational: your operational and administrative procedures
- Reputational: the character or goodwill of the business.
- Others include health and safety, project, equipment, security, technology, stakeholder management and service delivery.

**Identify the risk**<br>
Because of rapid changes in information technology, no list of risks can be exhaustive. Some of the risks and problems an organisation or enterprise may face applies to the activities across the platform.

1. Strategic Risk
These arise from the decisions made concerning the business. In this case, top management should be patient with the system as it takes time for different stakeholders to adapt and grasp the ins and outs of the system in their different capacities. Many a time top management will pull the plug on a concept too soon before it scales out fully. Which causes losses in time and finances.

2. Financial Risk 
These affect the crucial aspect of the organisation, the money. Financial risks that are transactional, such as delayed, partial or incomplete, incorrect payments have to cost to them. E.g. transferring funds back, bank charges, interest among other charges. For example an E-payment is structured perfectly to be used to carter for large scale transactions yet the business will have smaller customers who buy in retail. There is a handicap with the retail buyers as each of their transactions fetches a charge from their banks which is unfavourable to them.

3. Operational risk
Operational risk arises from the potential for loss due to significant deficiencies in system reliability or integrity. Operational risk can also arise from customer misuse, and from inadequately designed or implemented systems.

4. Security risks
- Fraud, false identity, being hacked. For those that agree to use the system, their first concern is how safe their information and data is from fraudsters who are many more in this day and age. User reassurance is essential.
- Customers using personal information (e.g., authentication information, credit card numbers or bank account numbers) in a non-secure electronic transmission could allow criminals to gain access to customer accounts.

5. Systems design, implementation, and maintenance
- This risk arises from the fact that from time to time there will be downtimes/interruptions so many a time a company is going to outsource their e-payment to mitigate such issue while exposing themselves to reliance on another company if the system it chooses is not compatible with user requirements.
- The rapid pace of change that characterises information technology presents e-platforms with the risk of systems obsolescence. For example, computer software that facilitates the use of electronic money products by customers will require updating, but channels for distributing software updates pose risks for the business in that criminal or malicious individuals could intercept and modify the software. In addition, rapid technological change can mean that staff may fail to understand fully the nature of new technology employed by the business and this could result in operational problems with the new or updated system.
- Awareness and culture, our society at this point is rigid to adjust to the changing technology. So getting them to adopt new technologies is a huge risk because some may welcome it while others will be adamant to make the change.
- Payment conflict as a result of system errors

**Customer misuse of products and services**
Impulse buying an example of customer misuse, this happens on the user end, it may not occur much in the business however this could be a result of system errors, system novices to curb this we would have to add two-factor authentication
