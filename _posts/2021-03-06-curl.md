title: Curl command
---
curl is a command line tool powered by Libcurl library to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). Since curl is designed to work without user interaction it is the prefered tool for automation.

You can use the curl command from your terminal, as it comes pre-installed on most Linux based Operating Systems.

Curl command use cases:
 Requesting a page:<br>
 If no argument is explicitly passed, curl command invokes an HTTP get request. This command will output the HTTP response of the URL in question displaying the static content of the page similar to the view page source option in a browser.

 > curl www.youtube.com

 Download a file:<br>
 There are two options of downloading and saving a file:
 
 1. Download a file and save it with the same name.
 >curl -O https://testdomain.com/testfile.tar.gz

 2. Download a file and save it with a custom name.
 >curl -o `custom_file_name.tar.gz` https://testdomain.com/testfile.tar.gz
