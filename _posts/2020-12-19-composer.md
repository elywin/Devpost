title: Composer PHP dependency manager

What is composer?<br>
Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manages them for you (installing or updating).

Why should you use composer?

If you have been using vanilla php for a while you find that you **recreate** the same tpe of functionality over and over again such as user authentication, application  routing, database management and not forgetting the helper classes and functions. wouldn`t it be better or more convenient to create this functionality once and **re-use** it in multiple projects?

You probably thinking "i can just copy over a file or line of code", but what if the environment changes or the codebase is different? You will have to rewrite code in-order to make it work with the new app.

Imagine you had a way of managing all your code and dependencies, then re-using your code on a new project would be much easier and convenient. And thats exactly why you need composer.
