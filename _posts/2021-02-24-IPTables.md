**What is IP-Tables, and How Does It Work?**<br>
iptables is a utility program (uses policy chains) that allows a system administrator to configure rules of the Linux kernel firewall to allow or block traffic.

**IP-Tables architecture**<br>
Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains. Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.

IP-Tables consists of different components as listed below:

**Chains:** Chains are a list of rules responsible for packets, they allow the administrator to control where in a packet’s delivery path a rule will be evaluated.

There are 5 chains in iptables and each is responsible for a specific task:
1. **Prerouting:** This chain decides what happens to a packet as soon as it arrives at the network interface, altering the packet, dropping the packet, or doing nothing at all.
2. **Input:** This chain is responsible for opening or blocking a port.
3. **Forward:** This chain is responsible for packet forwarding as the name suggests.
4. **Output:** This chain is in charge or all your browsing, with this chain you can allow a port to send or not to send any of your outbound traffic especially if you’re not sure what port each application is communicating through.
5. **Postrouting:** This cahin allows altering packets after they exit the OUTPUT chain just before leaving the computer..

**Tables:** <br>
 The table list contains filter, nat, mangle, raw and security. Each table is responsible for a specific task as we are going to see below:<br>
1. **Filter table:** This is the default table.It contains the built-in chains INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT. In this table is where you decide whether a packet is allowed in/out of your computer. If you want to block a port to stop receiving anything, this is where you do it.
2. **Nat table:** This table is responsible for creating new connection when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered.  It consists of three built-in chains: PREROUTING, OUTPUT, and POSTROUTING.
3. **Mangle table:** This table is responsible for specialized packets only. it changes or ulters something inside the packet either before coming in or leaving. It consists of PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, and POSTROUTING built-in chains.
4. **Raw:** This table is deals with the raw packet, it for tracking the connection state. It contains the following built-in chains: PREROUTING, OUTPUT.
5. **Security:** It is responsible for securing your computer after the filter table. Which consists of SELinux a security tool on modern linux distributions.

**A quick refresher, What is firewall?**<br>
 Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules established as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.<br>

**How to use IP-Tables?**<br>
Now that we know what IP Tables are and with that quick reminder about what a firewall is, lets see how to use them.<br>
