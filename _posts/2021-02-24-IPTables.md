**What is IP-Tables, and How Does It Work?**<br>
iptables is a utility program (uses policy chains) that allows a system administrator to configure rules of the Linux kernel firewall to allow or block traffic.

**IP-Tables architecture**<br>
Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains. Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.

iptables consists of different components which are discussed below:<br>
- **Chains:** Chains are a list of rules responsible for packets, they allow the administrator to control where in a packet’s delivery path a rule will be evaluated.

There are 5 chains in iptables and each is responsible for a specific task:
1. **Prerouting:** this chain decides what happens to a packet as soon as it arrives at the network interface, altering the packet, dropping the packet, or doing nothing at all.
2. **Input:** this chain is responsible for opening or blocking a port.
3. **Forward:** This chain is responsible for packet forwarding as the name suggests.
4. **Output:** THis chain is in charge or all your browsing, with this chain you can allow a port to send or not to send any of your outbound traffic especially if you’re not sure what port each application is communicating through.
5. **Postrouting:** This cahin allows altering packets after they exit the OUTPUT chain just before leaving the computer..

- **Targets:** 


**A quick refresher, What is firewall?**<br>
 Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules established as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.<br>

**How to use IP-Tables?**<br>
Now that we know what IP Tables are and with that quick reminder about what a firewall is, lets see how to use them.<br>
